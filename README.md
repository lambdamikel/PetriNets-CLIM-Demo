# PetriNets-CLIM-Demo

A simple Petri Net editor and simulator written in Common Lisp using
CLIM (Common Lisp Interface Manager) for its GUI.

## About 

This was written in 2003 for a one [hour presentation / lecture about
CLIM](./clim.pdf) taught by the author to CS students at the
University of Hamburg. The simple CLIM Petri Net editor & simulator in
this repository was used as a running example in the lecture. It still
compiles with LispWorks 6.1 CLIM.
