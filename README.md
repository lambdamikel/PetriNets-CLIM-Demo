# PetriNets-CLIM-Demo

A simple Petri Net editor and simulator written in Common Lisp using CLIM (Common Lisp Interface Manager) for the GUI. 

## About 

This was written in 2003 for a one [hour presentation / lecture about CLIM](./clim.pdf) taught by the author to CS students at the University of Hamburg.

This simple CLIM Petri Net editor & simulator was used as a running example in this lecture. It still compiles with LispWorks 6.1 CLIM.
